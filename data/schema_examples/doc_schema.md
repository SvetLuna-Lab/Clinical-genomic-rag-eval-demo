# Document Schema (section-aware)
- Clinical notes: use `## HPI`, `## Assessment and Plan`, `## Pathology` headers.
- Genomic knowledge: short factual statements; source-friendly phrasing.
- PubMed abstracts: background/conclusion lines.

Chunking:
- Prefer section-aware chunks: keep header + 2–5 sentences.
- Keep chunks < 1k characters for better retrieval granularity.
